## What incidents are included in WHID?

WHID only tracks media reported security incidents that can be associated with a negative impact to a public web application (such as downtime, data leakage, planting of malware, etc...). We also try to limit the database only to targeted attacks, though the distinction between targeted and non-targeted attacks is grey.

The database does not include known vulnerabilities in web based applications, an area well covered by other databases such as [CVE](https://www.cve.org/). WHID does not include incidents in which web site were breached using operating system or network layer vulnerabilities.

We also consider most web site defacements as non targeted attacks and we do not include them in the database. We will, however, include defacements of high profile websites.  For information about web site defacements refer to [zone-h](https://zone-h.org/archive).

As those criteria are somewhat subjective, we welcome comments on the inclusion or exclusion of publicized security breaches.
