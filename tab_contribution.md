## How can I contribute?

You can help make WHID better. You don't need to invest a lot of time:

* If you encounter a new Web incident, use the [WHID Submittal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRxE1DqOsgKf_nMNwtb2vY3EBRKsBgc0-sBzVdj5zud0HwEQ/viewform?embedded=true&formkey=dHktV0FmWGMyTDZPbkZtOEJXNzhPbXc6MQ&pli=1)
* As we speak English we miss alot in non English speaking countries so we are especially looking for non English sources. As long as they can be translated using Google translate of a similar service, we can include it.
* If you want to contribute more, become a WHID editor. Send an e-mail to the project leaders with a few words (and preferably a link) about yourself and sign up to this site. We will activate your account and enable you to edit incidents. We need you to:
add past incidents.
