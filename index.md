## OWASP/WASC Web Hacking Incidents Database (WHID) Project
WHID is a project dedicated to maintaining a list of publicly referenceable web applications related security incidents.

## Description
WHID's goal is to serve as a tool for raising awareness of the web application security problem and provide information for statistical analysis of web applications security incidents. The database is unique in tracking **only media reported security incidents that can be associated with a web application security vulnerability**. While the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) focuses on **_vulnerability prevalence_** WHID provides complimentary data the **types of vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited by threat actors**.
